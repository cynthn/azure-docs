# Quickstart: Analyze a Disk Image with Python

In this quickstart, you analyze an image from disk using Computer Vision.

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Analyze an image from disk

This sample is similar to [Analyze an image](python-analyze.md) except the image to analyze is read from disk. Two changes are required:

- Add a `{"Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"}` header to the request.
- Add the image data (byte array) to the body of the request.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code to a new Python script file.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the `vision_base_url` value to the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Change the `image_path` value to the path of a local image.
1. Run the script.

The following code uses the Python `requests` library to call the Computer Vision Analyze Image API. It returns the results as a JSON object. The API key is passed in via the `headers` dictionary. The types of features to recognize is passed in via the `params` dictionary. The binary image data is passed in via the `data` parameter to `requests.post`.

## Analyze Image request

```py
# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the westcentralus region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

vision_analyze_url = vision_base_url + "analyze"

# Set image_path to the local path of an image that you want to analyze.
image_path = "C:/Documents/ImageToAnalyze.jpg"

import requests
# Read the image into a byte array
image_data = open(image_path, "rb").read()
headers    = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key,
              'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'}
params     = {'visualFeatures': 'Categories,Description,Color'}
response   = requests.post(vision_analyze_url, headers=headers,
                           params=params, data=image_data)
response.raise_for_status()

# The 'analysis' object contains various fields that describe the image. The most
# relevant caption for the image is obtained from the 'descriptions' property.
analysis = response.json()
image_caption = analysis["description"]["captions"][0]["text"].capitalize()

# Display the image and overlay it with the caption.
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
#%matplotlib inline
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
_ = plt.title(image_caption, size="x-large", y=-0.1)
```

## Analyze Image response

A successful response is returned in JSON, for example:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "outdoor_",
      "score": 0.00390625,
      "detail": {
        "landmarks": []
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "outdoor_street",
      "score": 0.33984375,
      "detail": {
        "landmarks": []
      }
    }
  ],
  "description": {
    "tags": [

      "walking",

      "crowd",
      "umbrella",
      "riding",
      "tall",
      "woman",
      "bus"
    ],
    "captions": [
      {
        "text": "a group of people on a city street at night",
        "confidence": 0.9122243847383961
      }
    ]
  },
  "color": {
    "dominantColorForeground": "Brown",
    "dominantColorBackground": "Brown",
    "dominantColors": [
      "Brown"
    ],
    "accentColor": "B54316",
    "isBwImg": false
  },
  "requestId": "c11894eb-de3e-451b-9257-7c8b168073d1",
  "metadata": {
    "height": 600,
    "width": 450,
    "format": "Jpeg"
  }
}
```

Explore a Python application that uses Computer Vision to perform optical character recognition (OCR); create smart-cropped thumbnails; plus detect, categorize, tag, and describe visual features, including faces, in an image.
