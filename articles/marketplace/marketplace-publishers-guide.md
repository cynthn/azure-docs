### Go-To-Market Benefits  
Azure Marketplace and AppSource enable you to showcase your solutions to millions of customers. New listings in the marketplace are automatically offered a set of free GTM benefits to help drive awareness of your offer to Microsoft customers.  

Listing your offer in the marketplace storefront is a launchpad for joint GTM activities with Microsoft and the doorway to a Co-sell Ready partnership opportunity. All new listings are automatically offered a set of no cost GTM benefits to help drive awareness of your offer to Microsoft customers. The GTM benefits deliver a variety of co-marketing and co-sell activities designed to leverage the Microsoft brand, channels, customers, and partners to help you drive awareness for their solution and generate sales.

## Storefronts  
Microsoft provides two distinct storefronts on the marketplace that enable you to list offers, enable trials, and transact directly with Microsoft customers and ecosystem.  
*   AppSource 
    *   For more information about AppSource, visit the [Grow your business with AppSource](#Grow-your-business-with-AppSource) section.  
*   Azure Marketplace 
    *   For more information about Azure Marketplace, visit the [Grow your business with Azure Marketplace](#Grow-your-business-with-Azure-Marketplace) section.  

The storefronts enable you to find, try, and buy apps and services that accelerate your digital transformation. The storefronts help you grow your businesses by increasing access to Microsoft customers and partner ecosystems.  
 
Each storefront provides specialized options to help you maximize your publishing investment. The following table summarizes these options.  

|  | [AppSource](#AppSource) | [Azure Marketplace](#Azure-Marketplace) |

### Comparing AppSource and Azure Marketplace  
Each storefront serves unique customer requirements. The storefronts enable targeting by role, so you are able to offer the right solution or service based upon your customer.  

#### Understanding the Differences between the storefronts  
Choosing a storefront starts with identifying the target audience for your offer. If your solution targets both audiences, then you are able to publish once in order to list in both storefronts.  
 
You should consider the additional benefits for each storefront.   

##### AppSource  

| Storefront benefit | Details | 
|:--- |:--- | 
| ***Billing flexibility*** | Provides provisioning of a trial experience, but does not currently offer a commerce-enabled publishing option. You may use your current ordering and billing infrastructure with no additional investment or changes. | 
| ***Facilitation of connections with other partners*** | Independent software vendors, systems integrators, and managed service providers are able to be linked for specific implementation scenarios. This ability supports collaborative selling to new customers. | 
| ***Automation*** | Independent software vendors, systems integrators, and managed service providers are able to be linked for specific implementation scenarios, supporting collaborative selling to new customers. |  
| ***Multiple cloud types*** | Does not currently offer support for Azure Stack, Azure Government, or regional clouds. | 
| ***In-context presentation to customers*** | Reach more customers through the in-app experience for Microsoft products such as Dynamics 365, Power BI, and Office 365. |  

##### Azure Marketplace  

| Storefront benefit | Details | 
|:--- |:--- | 
| ***Billing flexibility*** | For VMs, Pay-As-You-Go billing options use Microsoft Enterprise Agreements (EAs) or web direct sales models. Pricing options also include a Free Tier subscription where an offering is perpetually free. They also include a Try It Now subscription that is promotionally free for a limited period, after which the VM is converted to a paid subscription. BYOL activation is also an option for supporting you.<br />For both billing options, in scenarios where virtual machines are deployed using Azure apps: Solution templates or Azure apps: Managed apps, all provisioned Azure resources are billed directly to the customer. | 
| ***Facilitation of connections with other partners*** | Does not currently enable you to link a service provider or delivery partners to the offer, but this functionality is launching in 2018. | 
| ***Automation*** | Does not currently enable you to link a service provider or delivery partners to the offer. Take advantage of automated SaaS with add-in provisioning. Use Azure apps: Solution templates to automate SaaS-based data collection and deployment scenarios. |  
| ***Multiple cloud types*** | Publish both public cloud and on-premises solutions through Azure Stack or publish to Azure Government and regional clouds, including China and Germany. | 
| ***In-context presentation to customers*** | Make your solution available in the Azure in-portal experience for contextual search using virtual machines and Azure apps: Solution templates. |

### Using Azure AD to enable trials  
Azure AD is a cloud identity service that enables authentication with a Microsoft work or school account by using industry-standard frameworks: OAuth and OpenID Connect.  
*   For more information about Azure AD, visit the Azure Active Directory page located at [azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory).  

Microsoft authenticates all marketplace users with Azure AD. When an authenticated user clicks through your trial listing in the marketplace and is redirected to your trial environment, you are able to provision the user directly into a trial without requiring additional sign-in steps. Your app receives a token from Azure AD during authentication that includes valuable user information for creating a user account in your app. You are able to automate the provisioning experience and increase the likelihood of conversion.  
*   For more information about the token sent from Azure AD during authentication, visit the Sample Tokens section located at [docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-token-and-claims#sample-tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-token-and-claims#sample-tokens)

You may use Azure AD to enable one-click authentication in your app or trial.  
*   Streamline the customer experience from marketplace to trial.  
*   Maintain the feel of an in-product experience, even when the user is redirected from the Marketplace to your domain or trial environment.  
*   Decrease the likelihood of abandonment on redirect, because there are no additional sign-in steps.  
*   Reduce deployment barriers for the large population of Azure AD users.  

#### Certify Your Azure AD Integration for the Marketplace: Multitenant Apps  
You may use Azure AD to support the following today.  
*   Register your app in the Azure portal.  
*   Enable the multitenancy support feature in Azure AD to get a one-click trial experience.  
*   For more information about app registration, visit the Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory page located at [docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications).  

You should perform the following steps if you are new to Azure AD federated SSO.  
*   Register your app in the marketplace. 
*   Develop SSO with Azure AD by using OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0. 
    *   For more information about Open ID Connect, visit the OpenID Connect page located at [docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-openid-connect-code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-openid-connect-code).  
    *   For more information about OAuth 2.0, visit the OAuth 2.0 page located at [docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code).  
*   Enable the multitenancy support feature in Azure AD to provide a one-click trial experience.
*   For more information about AppSource certification, visit the AppSource certification page located at [docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified). 

#### Certify Your Azure AD Integration for the Marketplace: Single-Tenant Apps  
You may use one of the following options for single-tenant apps.  
*   Add users to your directory as guest users by using Azure AD B2B.  
    *   For more information about Azure AD B2B, visit the What is Azure AD B2B collaboration page located at [docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b).
*   Manually provision trials for customers using Contact Me.  
*   Develop a per-customer test drive.  
*   Build a multitenant sample demo app with SSO.

## Guidelines and How To Guides  

### Guidelines for creating a Microsoft ID to manage an Azure Marketplace account  
If more than one person requires access to the same Microsoft ID used to create your Azure Marketplace account, then you should follow these guidelines to help you create a company account. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To authorize multiple users to access your Dev Center account, Microsoft recommends that you use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to assign roles to individual users. Each user must access the account by signing in with individual Azure AD credentials. Create your Microsoft ID by using an email address in a domain registered to your company. Microsoft suggests that the email about not be assigned to an individual. An example is `windowsapps@fabrikam.com`.  
>*   More information, visit the [Issue: Microsoft ID in an Azure AD federated domain](#Issue:-Microsoft-ID-in-an-Azure-AD-federated-domain) section.  

*   Limit access to the Microsoft ID to the smallest possible number of developers. 
*   Set up a corporate email distribution list that includes everyone who must access your Dev Center account, and add the new email address to your security information. This enables all of the employees on the list to receive security codes when requested and to manage the security information for your Microsoft ID. If setting up a distribution list is not feasible, then the owner of the individual email account must be available to access and share the security code when prompted.  
    *   For example, the owner is prompted when new security information is added to the account or when it must be accessed from a new device.  
*   Add a company phone number that does not require an extension and is accessible to key team members.  
*   In general, you should require developers to use trusted devices to sign into the Dev Center account for your company. All key team members should have access to the trusted devices. Using trusted devices to access reduces the requirement for sending security codes when someone is accessing the account.  
*   If you are required to grant access to the account from a non-trusted computer, then you should limit access to a maximum of five developers. Ideally, your developers should access the account from machines that share the same geographical and network location.  
*   Frequently review and verify the security information for your company.  
    *   To view your security information, visit the Security settings page located at [account.live.com/proofs/Manage](https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage).

Your Dev Center account should be primarily accessed from trusted computers. This is critical, because there is a limit to the number of codes generated per account per week. Using trusted computers also enables the most seamless sign-in experience. 
*   For more information about additional Dev Center account guidelines and security, visit the Opening a developer account page located at [docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/opening-a-developer-account](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/opening-a-developer-account).

#### Issue: Microsoft ID in an Azure AD federated domain  
Your corporate account may be federated through Azure Active Directory. If you try to create a Microsoft ID with a corporate email address, then you receive an error. If you receive an error, then you should check with your IT team to confirm your account is federated through Azure AD. This is a known issue and Microsoft is working to resolving it.  
*   For more information about Azure AD, visit the Azure Active Directory Documentation page located at [docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

As a workaround, Microsoft recommends that you follow these steps to create a new email address in the `outlook.com` domain and create a rule to forward your communications.  
1.  Go to the [sign up](https://signup.live.com/signup) page and click on the Get a new email address link. 
2.  Create the new email address and enter a password. This creates both a new Microsoft ID and an email mailbox in the `outlook.com` domain. Continue the registration process until the account is created.  

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >You must use an email address or distribution list that is registered as a Microsoft ID to register in Dev Center. Microsoft recommends that you use a distribution list to remove dependency from individuals. If your email address or distribution list is not registered, then you must register now.  
    >*   To register your Microsoft ID, visit the Create account page located at [signup.live.com/signup](https://signup.live.com/signup).  

    >[!Important]
    >If your any email address is located in the *Microsoft company domain*, then you are not able to use it for registration in Dev Center.  

3.  After you create the Microsoft ID with the Outlook email address, sign into your Outlook mailbox. Create an email forwarding rule to move all emails sent to the Outlook mailbox to the email address in your domain that you created to manage your Azure Marketplace account.  
    *   To sign into your outlook mailbox, visit the Outlook page located at [outlook.live.com/owa](https://outlook.live.com/owa/).  
    *   For more information about forwarding rules, visit the Use rules in Outlook Web App to automatically forward messages to another account page located at [support.office.com/article/Use-rules-in-Outlook-Web-App-to-automatically-forward-messages-to-another-account-1433e3a0-7fb0-4999-b536-50e05cb67fed](https://support.office.com/article/Use-rules-in-Outlook-Web-App-to-automatically-forward-messages-to-another-account-1433e3a0-7fb0-4999-b536-50e05cb67fed).  

4.  After you set up a forwarding rule, Outlook sends all emails and communications from your Outlook mailbox to the email address in a domain registered to your company. You must use the `outlook.com` email address to authenticate in both Dev Center and Cloud Partner Portal.

### How to Add bank and tax information  
The bank and tax information is required for all commercial offers using the transact listing type.  
*   If you are publishing commercial offers for purchase, then you must add payout and tax information and request validation in Dev Center.  

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >For commercial offers (transact), you must complete the bank and tax information before you are able to push your offers to production.  

*   If you are publishing only free or BYOL offers, then you are not required to add the information. You may add the information later, but validation of the tax information takes some time. If you plan to offer commercial offers for purchase, then you should add the information as soon as possible.  

#### Add bank information  
1.  Sign into Dev Center using your Microsoft ID.  
    *   To sign into Dev Center, visit the Windows Dev Center page located at [dev.windows.com](https://dev.windows.com).  
2.  Select Payout account on the left menu.
3.  On the Choose payment method page, select `Bank account` or `PayPal`.  

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If you have commercial offers that customers purchase in the Marketplace, then your payout account is where you receive payout for the purchases.  

4.  Enter the payment information. After you have verified that the information is correct, click on the Save button.  

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If you update or change your payout account, then you must follow the same steps replacing the current information with the new information. Changies to your payout account may delay payments up to one payment cycle. This delay occurs because Microsoft must verify the account change, this is the same as when you first set up your payout account. You get paid the full amount after your account has been verified. Any payments due from the current payment cycle are added to the next cycle.  

4.  Click on the Next button.

### Billing Options  

#### Marketplace Commercial Considerations  
There are no fees for participating in the Marketplace. There is no revenue share for participating in the Marketplace when you publish using the list, trial, and BYOL transact options.  
*   For more information, visit the Azure Marketplace Participation Policies page located at [azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies). 

#### Pay-As-You-Go and Bring Your Own License Billing Options  
When you use a Pay-As-You-Go billing model as a publishing option, your usage-based software licensing revenue is shared 80/20 between you and Microsoft. A single offer may be priced using both Pay-As-You-Go and Bring Your Own License (BYOL) billing models, and the two billing models coexist at the offer level as separate SKUs. You configure the billing models in your offer on Cloud Partner Portal. 

Consider the following example.  
*   If you enable the Pay-As-You-Go option.  

    | Your license cost | $1.00 per hour |

#### Single-billing and Payment Methods  
An important benefit of using the transact listing option is that Microsoft may single-bill your licensing costs at the same time as the underlying Azure usage directly to your customer. In this scenario, Microsoft bills and collects on your behalf, which removes the requirement for you to create your own procurement relationship with your customer. This may save you time and resources; helping you to focus on landing the sale, rather than collecting the bill. 

#### Enterprise Agreement  
If you are an Enterprise Agreement (EA) customer with Microsoft, then you may use an EA to pay for Microsoft products, including Azure usage. This payment option is designed for organizations that want to license software and cloud services for three or more years. You have the option to spread payments instead of one making up-front payment. If you use Pay-As-You-Go transact listing type, then the billing for your software licensing costs follows the quarterly EA overage billing cycle.  

##### Monetary Commitment  
If you are an EA customer, then you may add Azure to your agreement by making an upfront monetary commitment to Azure. That commitment is consumed throughout the year by using any combination of the wide variety of cloud services that are provided from the Azure global datacenters.
