# Offer listing best practices

This section provides best practices and suggestions for publishing engaging marketplace offers. To write and configure your marketing materials log into [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).

## Storefront offer details

| Storefront setting | Best practice |
|:--- |:--- |  
| Offer Name | Provide a clear title that includes search keywords to help customers discover your offer. <br> <br> For Consulting Services, follow this format: [Offer Name: [Duration] [Offer Type] (for example, *Contoso: 2-Week Implementation*) <br> <br> Adhere to brand guidelines: follow [Microsoft Trademark and Brand Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/general.aspx) and other product-specific guidelines when you refer to Microsoft trademarks and names of Microsoft software, products, and services. |
| Offer Description | Provide a clear description that describes your offer's value proposition in the first few sentences, keeping in mind that those sentences may be used in search engine results. Core components of your value proposition should include: <br> <br> <ul> <li>Description of the product or solution</li> <li>User persona that benefits from the product or solution</li> <li>Customer need or pain the product or solution addresses</li> </ul> <br> <br> Use industry standard vocabulary or benefit-based wording when possible. Do not rely on features and functionality to sell your product. Instead, focus on the value you deliver. For Consulting Service listings, clearly state the professional service you provide. |

## Link to your offer page from your website

When you link from the AppSource or Azure Marketplace badge on your site to your listing in the marketplace, you can support strong analytics and reporting by including the following query parameters at the end of the URL:
* **src**: Include the source from which the traffic is routed to AppSource (for example, website, LinkedIn, or Facebook).
* **mktcmpid**: Your marketing campaign ID, which can contain up to 16 characters in any combination of letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (for example, *blogpost_12*).

The following example URL contains both of the preceding query parameters:
`https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.04931187-431c-415d-8777-f7f482ba8095?src=website&mktcmpid=blogpost_12`

By adding the parameters to your AppSource URL, you can review the effectiveness of your campaign in the analytics dashboard in [Cloud Partner portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights).
