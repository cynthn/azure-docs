> [!NOTE]
> Cloudyn is being deprecated by the end of 2020. Existing Cloudyn features are being integrated directly into the Azure portal wherever possible. No new customers are being onboarded at this time, but support will remain for the product until it is fully deprecated. For more information, see [Cloudyn features moving to Azure Cost Management](../articles/cost-management-billing/cloudyn/overview.md#cloudyn-features-moving-to-azure-cost-management).
